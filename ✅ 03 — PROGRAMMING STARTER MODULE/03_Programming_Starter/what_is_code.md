# 🧩 What Is Code?

Code is a set of instructions written for a computer.

It tells the computer:
- what to do  
- how to do it  
- when to do it

## 🎯 Simple Explanation
Code = instructions  
Computer = follower

If instructions are clear → device works.  
If instructions are wrong → bugs happen.

## 🟦 Languages
Just like human languages, there are computer languages:
- Python  
- JavaScript  
- C  
- C++  
- SG CODE (your command layer)

Each language has its own style and purpose.
