# 🌍 What Is the Digital World?

The digital world is everything that exists inside computers, smartphones, and the internet.  
It is the "invisible universe" built from numbers, logic, and electricity.

## 🧠 Why Is It Important?
Because almost everything today runs on digital systems:
- Messaging
- Banking
- Social media
- Navigation
- Shopping
- Hospitals
- Government systems
- AI tools like ChatGPT

Understanding the digital world means you can:
- Work faster  
- Solve problems  
- Build new ideas  
- Protect yourself from scams  
- Create apps, websites, and digital tools

## 🟦 How It Works (Simple Version)
A digital system uses:
1. **Electricity** (0 = off, 1 = on)  
2. **Logic** (if this → do that)  
3. **Programs** that follow rules  
4. **Devices** like phones or computers  
5. **Networks** that connect everything

This repo will guide you step-by-step to understand all of it.
